# Project Tasks

## Immediate Priorities (High)

*   [ ] Nail the mental model
*   [ ] Keep everything simple and inspectable
*   [ ] Avoid premature abstractions
*   [ ] Make it fun, not enterprise-heavy
*   [ ] Optimize for learning and exploration

## Near-Term Tasks (Medium)

*   [ ] Inspector: editable fields (still mocked)
*   [ ] Click → selection propagation everywhere
*   [ ] View tree refinements (components, slots, bindings)
*   [ ] Flow discovery rules (dot notation, folders)
*   [ ] Better visual hierarchy & spacing
*   [ ] Keyboard-first navigation

## Future Direction (Low)

*   [ ] Real HTML parsing → tree, behaviours, frontend integration, full stack
*   [ ] Real contracts (schemas)
*   [ ] Flow execution sandbox
*   [ ] Logs & trace visualization
*   [ ] Local + cloud deploy targets
*   [ ] Plugin system for languages/frameworks
*   [ ] Export to real projects
